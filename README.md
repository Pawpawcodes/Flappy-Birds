# Flappy-Bird-Console Edition (C++)
Flappy Bird â€“ Console Edition is a lightweight C++ game that runs entirely in the Windows console. Built with a custom text-based game engine, it features simple graphics made from Unicode characters, smooth gameplay, basic physics for gravity and flapping, collision detection with pipes, and score tracking.

## ðŸŽ® Features
- **Console-based graphics** using Unicode characters
- **Smooth gameplay loop** without external dependencies
- **Score tracking** (Attempts & Max Flaps)
- **Collision detection** with pipes & ground
- **Restart system** after game over
- Customisable screen size and colors

âš™ How It Works
The game is built using:

Custom Console Game Engine

Handles drawing characters, filling areas, and writing to the console buffer.

No std::thread â€” single-threaded loop for compatibility.

Game Logic

Bird position & velocity updated using basic physics (gravity & flap boost).

Pipes are stored in a std::list and move across the screen.

Collision detection checks console buffer for overlaps with pipe characters.

Rendering

Draws background, pipes, and bird each frame.

Uses Unicode block characters (â–ˆ) for solid graphics.

ðŸ•¹ Controls
Spacebar â†’ Flap upward

Avoid pipes & ground

Release Spacebar after game over to restart
